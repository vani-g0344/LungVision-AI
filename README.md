# LungVision-AI

An end-to-end AI system for lung cancer detection from chest X-ray images.
The project focuses on explainable deep learning, Gen-AI powered medical
summaries, and full-stack deployment.

## Goals
- Detect lung cancer using deep learning
- Visualize model decisions using Grad-CAM
- Generate human-readable explanations using Gen-AI
- Deploy as a full-stack AI product

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python, CNNs, Transfer Learning
- Grad-CAM (Explainability)
- FastAPI (Backend)
- React / Streamlit (Frontend)
- LLMs for medical summaries
