# LungVision-AI 🫁🤖

An end-to-end AI-powered system for lung cancer detection from CT scan images, focused on **explainability, deployment, and real-world usability**.

## 🚀 Project Motivation
Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve survival rates.
This project explores how **deep learning + explainable AI** can assist medical professionals by not only predicting outcomes, but also **showing *why* a model makes a decision**.

As a Computer Science undergraduate aspiring to become a **Gen-AI / Full-Stack AI Engineer**, this project is built with a **product-first mindset**, not just model accuracy.
